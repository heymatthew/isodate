# isodate
Prints out an ISO8601 formatted date and time

On OSX, `date -I` hasn't done what I want it to. Recent versions of OSX have made the date command behaves even more strangely adding information that I wasn't interested in.

# Usage

```sh
isodate
```

# Install

```sh
go install github.com/heymatthew/isodate
```
